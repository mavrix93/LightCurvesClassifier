DaCHS-related javascript; there's a chapter on this in develNotes.rstx

Here's when we last pulled the stuff (source URLs are in develNotes)

samp.js -- 2012-12
jquery-gavo.js -- 2011-09
jquery.flog.js -- 2011-11

NOTE: locally developed code has .src.js extensions and is *not* (usually)
served to the net.  All standard templates use the versions without src.  

To update what's going out to the web, run ``make``.
